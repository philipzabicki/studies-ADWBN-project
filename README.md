# LDA and Logistic Regression Classification Project
## Description
This project aims to build and compare two classification models: one based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the other on logistic regression with penalty functions. The objective is to classify data using the first two canonical variables and to compare the performance of both models using cross-validation techniques.

## Tasks
LDA Classifier: Construct an LDA model for classification using the first two canonical variables and generate a plot with classification regions.

Logistic Regression: Create a logistic regression model capable of handling multiple classes, with an applied penalty function. Tune the penalty function parameters to minimize the probability of misclassification, using both k-fold and 10-fold cross-validation.

Model Comparison: Compare the probabilities of misclassification between the two models using the aforementioned cross-validation techniques.
